# Note-Taker
This application can write, save, and delete notes. It uses an express backend to save and retrieve data from a JSON file.

Initial starter files included a db.json and all files within the public folder, making up the frontend of this application. The backend was created thereafter to connect the two and make the app fully functional.

**Deployed through Heroku:** https://jungjungie-note-taker.herokuapp.com/
